Usage Guide for Subdomain and IP Extractor (Multi-format)

1. Prepare your input file:
   - Supported formats: TXT, CSV, JSON, Excel (.xlsx), Word (.docx).
   - Ensure the file contains textual data with subdomains and/or IP addresses.

2. Run the program:
   - Execute the script from the command line:
     python3 SubdomainIPExtractor.py -i your_input_file.ext

3. Output files:
   - The program generates two files in the current directory:
     * subdomains.txt  - sorted list of unique subdomains found.
     * ips.txt         - sorted list of unique IPv4 addresses found.

4. Notes:
   - The program validates IPv4 addresses and filters out invalid entries.
   - It excludes reverse DNS entries (e.g., *.in-addr.arpa).
   - Works with any text content extracted from supported file formats.
   - Requires necessary Python libraries installed (see requirements).
